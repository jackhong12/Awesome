      We explore a new approach to redundancy in cyber-physical systems, aiming to provide a flexible and cost-effective solution as these systems become more widespread. Traditionally, fault tolerance in systems like aircraft flight control relies on dedicated redundancies. We propose using neural network models trained on data from normal program executions to replace faulty functionalities during failures. The approach was tested on cyber-physical systems like ArduPilot and OpenPilot, showing that the models could synthesize redundancies for both numerical and logical programs, effectively preventing bugs and security vulnerabilities in the original systems.
